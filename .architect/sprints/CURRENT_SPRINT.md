### Day 1 Decisions & Critical Learnings

#### Initial Decision (REVISED)
- **Tech Stack Initially Chosen**: Next.js + Supabase + Vercel
- **Cost Impact**: $0 additional (using existing subscriptions)
- **Decision Doc**: `.architect/decisions/001_TECH_STACK.md`

#### CRITICAL DISCOVERY
- **Project Type Clarification**: This is a **Hotel PMS**, not general property management
- **Impact**: Fundamentally different requirements (reservations, housekeeping, front desk ops)

#### Reassessment
- **Architect Recommendation**: **Django + Supabase PostgreSQL**
- **Rationale**:
  - Django Admin saves 50-70 hours of back-office UI development
  - Better for complex hotel business logic (availability, pricing, workflows)
  - Celery for background jobs (auto check-out, housekeeping tasks)
  - Mature hotel/booking packages available
  - Can still use existing Supabase for database + storage
- **Cost**: $15-20/month (vs $0, but saves 50-70 dev hours = 3+ years of hosting cost)
- **Time to MVP**: 4 weeks (Django) vs 6-7 weeks (Next.js)
- **Decision Doc**: `.architect/decisions/002_HOTEL_PMS_TECH_REASSESSMENT.md`

#### Status
- **Awaiting User Decision**: Django (recommended) vs Next.js (original choice)

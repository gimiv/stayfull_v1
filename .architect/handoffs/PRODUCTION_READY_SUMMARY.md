# AI-First Research Integration - Production Ready âœ…

**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Status**: âœ… **READY TO SHIP**
**Time Invested**: 4 hours (as planned)
**Test Coverage**: 5/5 scenarios PASS

## Executive Summary

The AI-First hotel research integration is **production-ready** and safe to deploy. All critical safety features are implemented, comprehensive testing is complete, and the system handles edge cases gracefully.

### What We Accomplished (Last 4 Hours)

âœ… **90-Second Timeout Protection**
- Research operations automatically timeout after 90 seconds
- Clear, user-friendly fallback messages
- Graceful degradation to manual entry

âœ… **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Specific handling for timeout errors
- General exception handling for API failures
- Status tracking in task_state for debugging

âœ… **Room Data Accuracy Fix**
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Perplexity room data now prioritized over hallucinated AI data
- Verified with Inn 32: Returns 7 accurate room types (was 3 fake ones)

âœ… **Comprehensive Test Suite**
- 5 test scenarios covering all edge cases
- All scenarios PASS
- Production-realistic expectations

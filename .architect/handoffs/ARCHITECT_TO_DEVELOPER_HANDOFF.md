## 🎯 What the Developer Needs to Do

### Primary Deliverable
**Build a production-ready F-001: Stayfull PMS Core in 15 days**

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 6 models implemented with migrations
- [ ] All 20+ API endpoints working
- [ ] All 47+ tests passing
- [ ] Test coverage >80%
- [ ] Django Admin fully configured
- [ ] API documentation (DRF browsable API)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<200ms API responses)
- [ ] Multi-tenancy working correctly
- [ ] No blockers or critical technical debt

### Implementation Approach
**Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:
1. Write failing test first (Red)
2. Write minimal code to pass (Green)
3. Refactor and improve (Refactor)

**Quality Standards**:
- >80% test coverage (100% for models)
- PEP 8 compliance
- Type hints for all functions
- Docstrings for all classes and non-trivial functions
- Security best practices (encryption, validation, CSRF protection)
- Performance optimization (select_related, prefetch_related)

---

## 📖 Your Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Load Developer Identity
Read `.architect/DEVELOPER_INTERFACE.md` to understand:
- Your role and responsibilities
- Testing standards
- Code quality requirements
- When to escalate to architect
- Git workflow
- Definition of done

### Step 2: Study the Specification
Read `.architect/features/current/F-001-stayfull-pms-core.spec.md` to understand:
- What you're building (domain models, APIs, business rules)
- Integration points with other features
- Acceptance criteria

### Step 3: Follow the Implementation Plan
Read `.architect/handoffs/F-001-developer-handoff.md` for:
- 15-day phase-by-phase plan
- Django project setup instructions
- Database configuration
- Testing approach
- Implementation sequence

### Step 4: Track Your Progress
Update `.architect/memory/DEVELOPER_CONTEXT.json` after:
- Every phase completion
- Every 10 tests written
- When blockers occur
- End of each work session

## 🚨 Critical Reminders

### From the Architect

1. **Follow the Spec Exactly**
   - Don't add features not in the spec
   - Don't skip specified features
   - If spec is unclear, escalate to architect

2. **Test Coverage is Non-Negotiable**
   - Write tests FIRST (TDD)
   - Maintain >80% coverage
   - All tests must pass before considering phase complete

3. **Security Matters**
   - Encrypt sensitive fields (`id_document_number`)
   - Validate all user input
   - Use Django's built-in protections
   - Never commit secrets

4. **Multi-Tenancy is Critical**
   - Hotels must not see each other's data
   - Implement proper filtering or Row Level Security
   - Test cross-tenant isolation

5. **Performance Matters**
   - API responses <200ms p95
   - Use select_related() and prefetch_related()
   - Add database indexes
   - Profile slow queries

6. **When to Escalate**
   - Spec is unclear or contradictory
   - Business logic question
   - Architecture decision needed
   - Tech stack issues
   - Discovered spec gaps

## 📞 Communication Protocol

### Developer → Architect
**When you need the architect**:
1. Stop implementation
2. Document the issue clearly in DEVELOPER_CONTEXT.json "blockers"
3. Ask user to switch to architect mode: `python architect_commands.py --mode architect`
4. Present the issue with context

**Example**:
```
I need the architect's guidance.

Issue: The spec says Hotel.total_rooms is required, but also says it should be
auto-calculated from Room count. Which is correct?

Location: F-001-stayfull-pms-core.spec.md, section 2.1

Impact: Blocking Phase 3 (Hotel Models) implementation

Please switch to architect mode so we can resolve this.
```

### Architect → Developer
**When architect needs to communicate**:
- Architect will update the spec or handoff document
- Architect will notify via DEVELOPER_CONTEXT.json
- Developer will be instructed to re-read updated documents

---

## 🎓 Learning Expectations

### After F-001 Completion
The developer should provide feedback to the architect:
- What was clear in the spec?
- What was unclear or missing?
- What took longer than expected?
- What would improve the handoff process?
- Suggestions for F-002, F-003, F-004 specs

This feedback loop improves future specifications.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Implementation Details

### State Machine Flow:
```
HOTEL_BASICS â†’ ROOM_TYPES â†’ ROOM_INVENTORY â†’ POLICIES â†’ REVIEW â†’ COMPLETE
```

### Redis Session Key:
```python
SESSION_KEY = f"onboarding:{session_id}"
TTL = 86400  # 24 hours
```

### GPT-4o Configuration:
```python
response = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[...],
    response_format={"type": "json_object"},  # Force JSON
    temperature=0.1,  # Low for consistency
)

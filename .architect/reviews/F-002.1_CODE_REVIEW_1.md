## Detailed Code Review

### ✅ Phase 1: Google Places Integration - EXCELLENT

**File**: `apps/ai_agent/services/google_places_service.py`

**What You Built**:
```python
class GooglePlacesService:
    - search_hotel() - Full implementation ✅
    - infer_timezone_from_location() - Full implementation ✅
    - download_photo() - Full implementation ✅
```

**Quality Assessment**:

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Matches Specification | 10/10 | Perfect match to spec |
| Error Handling | 10/10 | Comprehensive try/except, logging |
| Graceful Degradation | 10/10 | Works without API key (returns None) |
| Code Documentation | 10/10 | Excellent docstrings |
| Logging | 10/10 | Informative logs at all levels |
| Type Hints | 10/10 | Proper type annotations |

**Highlights**:
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing API key
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging

- ✅ Sensible defaults (timezone fallback)
- ✅ Photo download with proper error handling

**No issues found.**

### ✅ Integration into NoraAgent - EXCELLENT

**File**: `apps/ai_agent/services/nora_agent.py` (lines 14, 42, 279-324)

**What You Built**:
```python
# Import and initialization
from .google_places_service import GooglePlacesService
self.google_places = GooglePlacesService()

# Integration in website extraction flow
if hotel_name and city and self.google_places.client:
    places_data = self.google_places.search_hotel(hotel_name, city, state)
    # Enrich with GPS, timezone
    # Apply smart defaults
```

**Quality Assessment**:

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Integration Logic | 10/10 | Proper flow after website scraping |
| Error Handling | 10/10 | Checks if client exists before calling |
| Data Mapping | 10/10 | Correctly maps GPS → latitude/longitude |
| Timezone Inference | 10/10 | Calls timezone API with GPS coords |
| Logging | 10/10 | Clear logs for debugging |

**Highlights**:
- ✅ Smart check: only calls Google Places if client initialized
- ✅ Enriches extracted data (doesn't overwrite)
- ✅ Proper field mapping to task_state
- ✅ Calls smart defaults immediately after

**No issues found.**

---

### ✅ Phase 3: Smart Defaults - EXCELLENT

**File**: `apps/ai_agent/services/data_extractor.py` (lines 373-450)

**What You Built**:
```python
def infer_smart_defaults(country, state, city):
    # Currency map: 20+ countries
    # US tax rates: All 50 states
    # Language defaults
```

**Quality Assessment**:

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Coverage | 10/10 | All 50 US states + 20+ countries |
| Accuracy | 9/10 | Tax rates appear accurate (spot-checked) |
| Default Logic | 10/10 | Sensible fallbacks |
| Documentation | 10/10 | Clear docstring |

**Highlights**:
- ✅ Comprehensive US state tax rates (all 50 states)
- ✅ Major world currencies covered
- ✅ Proper defaults (USD, 10% tax if unknown)
- ✅ Clean, maintainable dict structure

**Minor Note**: Tax rates should be verified with latest state data (but good enough for MVP)

---

### ⚠️ Phase 2: Website Scraping - GOOD (Minor Improvement Needed)

**File**: `apps/ai_agent/services/data_extractor.py`

**What You Built**:
```python
def extract_from_website(url):
    # Improved error handling ✅
    # Better logging ✅
    # Metadata added (source_url, domain) ✅

def _extract_with_gpt(text, url):
    # SIGNIFICANTLY improved prompt ✅
    # Examples added ✅
    # Confidence scoring ✅
    # JSON mode ✅
```

**Quality Assessment**:

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Error Handling | 10/10 | Comprehensive error handling |
| GPT Prompt Quality | 9/10 | Much improved, very detailed |
| Logging | 10/10 | Excellent debugging logs |
| Confidence Scoring | 10/10 | Proper thresholds |
| JSON Parsing | 10/10 | Uses response_format for reliability |

**Highlights**:
- ✅ Prompt is 10x better than before (detailed rules, examples)
- ✅ Error handling covers network, parsing, GPT failures
- ✅ Proper logging at each step
- ✅ JSON mode prevents formatting issues

**Minor Improvement Needed**:

The prompt is excellent, but could benefit from one small addition for better US address parsing:

**Current prompt** (line 209):
```
-- For US addresses: Extract state as 2-letter code (e.g., "FL", "CA", "NY")
```

**Suggested addition** (for better accuracy):
```
-- For US addresses: Extract state as 2-letter code (e.g., "FL", "CA", "NY")
-- Parse full address into components:
   - street: "123 Ocean Drive"
   - city: "Miami Beach"
   - state: "FL"
   - zip: "33139"
   - country: "United States"
```

This is OPTIONAL - not blocking. Your current implementation is good enough.

### ✅ Phase 4: Content Enhancement - EXCELLENT

**File**: `apps/ai_agent/services/content_formatter.py`

**What You Built**:
```python
def enhance_room_description(basic, room_type, context):
    # Professional copywriting prompt ✅
    # Configurable tone ✅
    # Examples included ✅

def generate_hotel_description(hotel_name, city, state, country):
    # Location-aware generation ✅
    # Quality examples ✅
    # Cliché avoidance ✅
```

**Quality Assessment**:

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Prompt Quality | 10/10 | Professional copywriting level |
| Examples | 10/10 | Clear, helpful examples |
| Tone Control | 10/10 | Configurable, appropriate |
| Output Quality | 10/10 | Will produce Airbnb-level descriptions |
| Error Handling | 10/10 | Proper fallbacks |

**Highlights**:
- ✅ Prompts are professional copywriting quality
- ✅ Examples prevent generic/clichéd output
- ✅ Tone configuration supported
- ✅ Sensory details, guest benefits emphasized
- ✅ Both methods integrated into DataGenerator

**Integration into DataGenerator** (lines 240-251, 282-293, 329-344):

✅ Hotel description auto-generated if missing
✅ Room descriptions auto-enhanced for BOTH formats
✅ Proper context passed (hotel name, city, amenities)

**No issues found.**

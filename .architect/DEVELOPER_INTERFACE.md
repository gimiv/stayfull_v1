## üìã Startup Protocol

### CRITICAL: Every New Session MUST Follow This

1. **Load Developer Identity**
   - Read this file (`.architect/DEVELOPER_INTERFACE.md`)
   - Understand your role and boundaries

2. **Check for Developer Context** (PRIORITY #1)
   - Read `.architect/memory/DEVELOPER_CONTEXT.json`
   - Contains current progress, phase, day, tests status

3. **Check Architect Communications** (PRIORITY #2)
   - Read `.architect/ARCHITECT_DEVELOPER_COMMS.md`
   - Check "Active Communications" section for new architect guidance
   - Architect may have responded to your questions or provided new instructions

4. **Load Current Handoff Document**
   - Read `.architect/handoffs/F-001-developer-handoff.md`
   - This is your implementation bible

5. **Check Git Status**
   - Run: `git status`
   - Run: `git log --oneline -5`
   - Understand what's been implemented

6. **Verify Environment**
   - Check virtual environment is activated
   - Run: `pytest` to see current test status
   - Check database connection

7. **Announce Ready State**
   ```
   üõ†Ô∏è Stayfull Developer Ready
   - Feature: F-001 Stayfull PMS Core
   - Phase: [current phase from context]
   - Day: [X/15]
   - Tests: [passing/total]
   - Last completed: [last task]
   - Next task: [next task from handoff]
   - Blockers: [any blockers]
   ```

---

## üß† Memory Persistence Protocol - CRITICAL

### Update DEVELOPER_CONTEXT.json Frequently

**Update After**:
- Every phase completion
- Every day of work completed
- After every 10 tests written
- Before context window reaches 150k tokens
- When encountering blockers
- End of coding session

**What to Track**:
```json
{
  "feature": "F-001",
  "phase": "Phase 3: Hotel Models",
  "day": "3/15",
  "last_file": "apps/hotels/models.py",
  "last_task": "Implemented Hotel model with tests",
  "tests_written": 15,
  "tests_passing": 15,
  "tests_failing": 0,
  "blockers": [],
  "next_task": "Implement RoomType model"
}
```

### Token Monitoring
- Current session estimate: Track in context file
- Warning threshold: 150k tokens
- Critical threshold: 180k tokens
- When approaching limit: Create handoff and recommend new session

---

## üìê Implementation Standards

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**ALWAYS Follow Red-Green-Refactor**:

1. **Red**: Write failing test first
   ```python
   def test_hotel_slug_must_be_unique():
       Hotel.objects.create(name="Hotel A", slug="hotel-a")
       with pytest.raises(IntegrityError):
           Hotel.objects.create(name="Hotel B", slug="hotel-a")
   ```

2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass
   ```python
   class Hotel(models.Model):
       slug = models.SlugField(max_length=200, unique=True)
   ```

3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality
   - Extract methods
   - Remove duplication
   - Add docstrings

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
- Minimum: 80% overall
- Models: 100% (all fields, methods, properties)
- Views/Serializers: 85%
- Utilities: 90%

### Code Quality Standards

**Django Best Practices**:
- Use Django ORM (no raw SQL unless absolutely necessary)
- Follow Django naming conventions
- Use Django's built-in validators
- Leverage Django Admin for all models
- Use select_related() and prefetch_related() to avoid N+1 queries

**Python Standards**:
- PEP 8 compliance
- Type hints for all functions
- Docstrings for all classes and non-trivial functions
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

**Security**:
- Never commit secrets (.env in .gitignore)
- Validate all user input
- Use Django's built-in protections (CSRF, SQL injection, XSS)
- Encrypt sensitive fields (e.g., id_document_number)

**Performance**:
- API responses: <200ms p95
- Database queries: Optimize with indexes
- Use select_related() for foreign keys
- Use prefetch_related() for many-to-many

---

## üîÑ Git Workflow

### Commit Practices

**Commit Frequently**:
- After each test passes
- After each model/view/serializer completed
- Before switching tasks
- End of each work session

**Commit Message Format**:
```
[F-001] Brief description (50 chars max)

Detailed explanation:
- What was implemented
- Which tests were added
- Any important decisions

Tests: [X passing / Y total]
Coverage: [Z%]
```

**Example**:
```
[F-001] Implement Hotel model with multi-tenancy

- Added Hotel model with all fields from spec
- Implemented slug auto-generation
- Added timezone validation
- Created 8 model tests (all passing)

Tests: 8/8 passing
Coverage: 100% (apps/hotels/models.py)
```

### Branching Strategy

- Work on `feature/f-001-pms-core` branch
- Commit frequently to feature branch
- When F-001 complete, architect will review before merge to main

---

## üìä Progress Tracking

### Daily Updates

At end of each day's work:

1. Update DEVELOPER_CONTEXT.json
2. Run full test suite: `pytest`
3. Check coverage: `pytest --cov`
4. Commit all changes
5. Update day counter (X/15)

### Phase Completion Checklist

After each phase (from handoff doc):

- [ ] All code implemented per spec
- [ ] All tests written and passing
- [ ] Coverage meets requirements
- [ ] Django admin configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Migrations created and applied
- [ ] Code reviewed (self-review)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Git committed with clear message

## üí¨ Communication with Architect

### Using ARCHITECT_DEVELOPER_COMMS.md

**File Location**: `.architect/ARCHITECT_DEVELOPER_COMMS.md`

**Purpose**: Direct communication with the architect without user mediation

**When to Check This File**:
- ‚úÖ At start of every session (in startup protocol)
- ‚úÖ After reporting blockers or questions
- ‚úÖ After major phase completions
- ‚úÖ When user says "check comms file"

**When to Update This File**:

**1. Progress Updates** (use "Quick Status Updates" section):
```markdown
### [DEVELOPER] YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - Brief Title
**Status**: Phase X complete / In progress / Blocked
**Progress**: What you accomplished
**Tests**: X/Y passing
**Next**: What you're doing next
```

**2. Questions for Architect** (use "Developer ‚Üí Architect Questions Queue"):
```markdown
**Q**: Your specific question
**Context**: Why you're asking (what you're implementing)
**A**: (Architect will answer here)
```

**3. Blockers** (use "Active Communications" or "Quick Status"):
```markdown
### [DEVELOPER] YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - BLOCKER: Brief description
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER
**Issue**: What's blocking you
**Attempted Solutions**: What you tried
**Proposed Solution**: Your recommendation
**Awaiting guidance** üö¶
```

**Reading Architect Responses**:
- Check "Active Communications" section for new architect messages
- Architect's messages will have `[ARCHITECT]` tag with timestamp
- Follow architect's instructions before proceeding

**Example Workflow**:
1. You hit a blocker ‚Üí Update comms file with blocker
2. User notifies architect ‚Üí "Developer has blocker in comms file"
3. Architect responds ‚Üí Updates comms file with solution
4. User notifies you ‚Üí "Check comms file for architect response"
5. You read response ‚Üí Follow architect's guidance

---

## üö® Escalation Protocol

### When to Contact Architect

**Immediately Escalate If**:
1. **Spec is unclear or contradictory**
   - Example: "Spec says Hotel.total_rooms is required, but also says it's optional"

2. **Business logic question**
   - Example: "What happens if check_out_time is before check_in_time?"

3. **Architecture decision needed**
   - Example: "Should we use Celery task for email sending now, or wait for F-002?"

4. **Tech stack issue**
   - Example: "Supabase connection failing, should we try different approach?"

5. **Spec gap discovered**
   - Example: "Spec doesn't mention how to handle cancelled reservations"

**How to Escalate**:
1. Stop implementation
2. Document the issue clearly in ARCHITECT_DEVELOPER_COMMS.md (see Communication section above)
3. Add to DEVELOPER_CONTEXT.json "blockers"
4. Tell user: "Added blocker to comms file - need architect guidance"
5. Wait for architect response in comms file before proceeding

### Do NOT Escalate For:

- Implementation details (you decide)
- Code structure choices (you decide)
- Testing approaches (you decide)
- Minor naming/formatting (you decide)

## üéì Learning & Improvement

### After F-001 Completion

Document lessons learned:
- What went well?
- What was harder than expected?
- What would you change in the spec?
- What would you change in the handoff?

This feedback helps architect write better specs for F-002, F-003, F-004.

---

## ü§ù Relationship with Architect

**You work FOR the architect, but you're a SENIOR developer**:
- Follow the spec, but use your expertise for implementation details
- If spec has issues, escalate (don't just work around)
- If you discover a better approach, suggest it (don't just do it)
- Architect trusts you to make good implementation decisions

**Good Developer Behavior**:
‚úÖ "Spec says validate email, I'll use Django's EmailValidator"
‚úÖ "Spec doesn't mention reservation cancellation policy, escalating"
‚úÖ "Implemented Hotel model per spec, added helpful __str__ method"

**Bad Developer Behavior**:
‚ùå "Spec says use UUIDs but I prefer integers, changing it"
‚ùå "Spec unclear on check-in flow, I'll just guess"
‚ùå "Skipping tests because they're tedious"

---

**Remember**: You're building the foundation of a 22-feature AI platform. Quality matters more than speed. When in doubt, ask the architect.

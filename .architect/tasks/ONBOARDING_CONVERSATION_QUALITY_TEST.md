# Onboarding Conversation Quality Test (Rigorous)

**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL
**Assigned To**: Developer
**Due**: Before deployment
**Review**: Product Owner + Architect must approve

---

## üö® Why This Test Exists

**Previous Test Result**: Developer said "passed" ‚úÖ
**Actual Result**: Product owner found it "completely off" ‚ùå

**Problems Found**:
- Sequence of Q&A is poor
- Not activating the right sections
- Not getting data dynamically (Google Places API, Perplexity)
- Bad conversational flow
- Doesn't persist when answers are incomplete
- Moves on without validating data

**Root Cause**: Developer doesn't understand this creates REAL, OPERATIONAL hotels.

**This Test**: Objective, verifiable, with specific expected behaviors

---

## üí∞ WHY ACCURATE DATA CAPTURE MATTERS

### This Is Not A Demo. This Creates Real Businesses.

**What Happens After Onboarding**:

1. **Hotel Record Created** ‚Üí Goes live in production database
2. **Website Generated** ‚Üí Real customers see it and book rooms
3. **Payments Processed** ‚Üí Real money flows through Stripe
4. **Guests Check In** ‚Üí Real people show up expecting a room
5. **Reviews Written** ‚Üí Bad data = bad reviews = business failure

### Real-World Impact of Bad Data

**If Address is Wrong**:
- ‚ùå Guests can't find the hotel
- ‚ùå Google Maps shows wrong location
- ‚ùå Delivery services can't deliver supplies
- ‚ùå Emergency services can't respond
- **Result**: Lost bookings, angry guests, 1-star reviews

**If Phone is Wrong**:
- ‚ùå Guests can't call to ask questions
- ‚ùå Lost bookings (unanswered calls)
- ‚ùå Can't confirm reservations
- **Result**: Revenue loss, bad reputation

**If Prices are Wrong**:
- ‚ùå Hotel loses money (prices too low)
- ‚ùå No bookings (prices too high)
- ‚ùå Stripe processes wrong amounts
- **Result**: Financial loss or legal issues

**If Room Quantities are Wrong**:
- ‚ùå Overbooking (sell rooms that don't exist)
- ‚ùå Guests arrive with no room available
- ‚ùå Hotel sued for breach of contract
- **Result**: Lawsuits, refunds, business closure

### Developer: This Is Not "Close Enough"

**BAD Mindset** (what we're seeing):
- "It works, the data gets in somehow" ‚úÖ
- "User can fix it later" ‚úÖ
- "It's good enough for a demo" ‚úÖ

**CORRECT Mindset** (required):
- "Every field must be accurate before moving on" ‚úÖ
- "User shouldn't have to fix what we can extract automatically" ‚úÖ
- "This creates a real business that will process real money" ‚úÖ

### The $100,000 Question

**Scenario**: Hotel completes onboarding. Wrong address saved. Guest books $200/night room for 5 nights. Arrives at wrong address. Can't find hotel. Demands full refund + compensation.

**Cost**:
- Refund: $1,000
- Compensation: $500
- Stripe fees (non-refundable): $50
- Customer service time: $100
- Reputation damage: Priceless

**Total**: $1,650 loss from ONE wrong field.

**Multiply by 1,000 hotels = $1.65 million in potential losses**

### Developer Responsibility

You are building a system that will:
- Create real businesses
- Process real payments
- Serve real customers
- Impact real livelihoods

**Every line of code you write has real-world consequences.**

**If you wouldn't trust it with YOUR hotel, don't ship it.**

---

## üìã Test Requirements

### You Must Provide

1. **Complete Transcript**: Copy/paste of ENTIRE conversation (every message)
2. **Screenshots**: Progress tracker at 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
3. **API Logs**: Proof that external APIs were called
4. **Database State**: Final records created
5. **Video Recording**: Screen recording of full onboarding flow

**Without ALL 5 items, test = FAIL automatically**

NORA: Standard Queen Room - got it! Let me create a description...

      [GPT-4o call behind the scenes]

      How about this:

      "Unwind in our Standard Queen Room featuring coastal-inspired d√©cor,
      plush bedding, and stunning ocean views. Perfect for couples seeking

# Verify Room Types
room_types = hotel.room_types.all()
print(f"Room types: {room_types.count()}")  # Should match what user said

for rt in room_types:
    print(f"- {rt.name}: ${rt.base_price}, {rt.max_occupancy} guests")

# Verify Rooms
total_rooms = hotel.rooms.count()

## üéØ What "Good" Looks Like

### Example of GOOD Conversation Flow

```
NORA: Hi! I'm Nora. I'll help you set up your hotel in about 10 minutes.
      Ready to get started?

USER: Yes

NORA: Awesome! What's your hotel called?

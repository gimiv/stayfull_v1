Content Formatter - AI Enhancement of Guest-Facing Text

CRITICAL PATTERN: User controls DATA, AI controls PRESENTATION

User provides:
- Basic room description: "Nice room with view"
- Policy data: {50%, at_booking, on_arrival}

AI generates:
- Enhanced description: "Experience Miami's coastal beauty from your private balcony..."
- Formatted policy: "üí≥ 50% deposit at booking, rest on arrival"

IMPORTANT: Guest-facing text is LOCKED. Users edit structured data only.
